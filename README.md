SafeFam
===================================

This is an android application that helps find the safest route to take, that avoids certain danger points on the map, to go from one place to another. 

Implementation
---------------
This project used an implementation of a divide-and-conquer algorithm. We use data like quality of roads, and history of crimes in different places to mark danger points, and mark spots such as malls, movie theatres, and places with a high density of people as safe points.
